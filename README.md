You can access my resume by scanning the QR code above or clicking it directly.

You can also connect with me on LinkedIn: [Anubhav Mor LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anubhavmor/).

I'm excited to share my first public project, hosted on GitHub Pages. You can check it out here: [Project Link](https://anubhavmor.github.io/walls/).

I'd love to hear your thoughts and suggestions!

Thanks for your time!
